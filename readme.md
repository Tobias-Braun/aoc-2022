# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for 2022. The solutions are implemented in Python and organized by day, with a separate folder for each day's challenge.

## Getting Started

To use my solutions, clone or download this repository and navigate to the appropriate day's folder. Each folder contains the code for that day's challenge in the form of a Python script named `solution.py` and the input data for the challenge in a file named `input.txt`.

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the appropriate day's folder and run the `solution.py` Python script for that day. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, you would run the following command from the command line:

```bash
python solution.py
```
